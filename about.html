	<h3>When I am not coding I like to: </h3>
        	<ul class="about-section">
			      	<li>Play with my toy poodle, Abbi Gail.</li>
			      	<li>Watch nonsensical reality TV shows like "Real Housewives of Orange County," "The Kardashians," and "Real Housewives of Salt Lake City," just to name a few.</li>
			      	<li>Read books.  I now have time to read. One of my most favorite books is <i>Walden</i> by Henry David Thoreau.  
			      	<li>I also love to read books by authors from Arkansas.  One of the best books I've read lately from an Arkansas author was <i>They Call Her Dirty Sally</i> by Amy Matayo. I love my book club ladies.  They are so supportive and inspiring.</li>
			      	<li>Cook southern food. My specialty is a dish from Paula Deen called "Chicken in Wine Sauce."</li>
			      	<li>Help plan and host events.</li>
			      	<li>Sample new wines and cheeses with my girlfriends.</li>
				<li>Have full conversations with ChatGPT like it is my genius coworker.</li>
			      	<li>And...of course... the obligatory "spend time with family"...  But in all seriousness, I am the Best Aunt Ever.</li>

        <p class="p0"><span class="txt1">Long Story Short </span> Born Jami Lynn Rozell, I am a twin, and the product of invitro fertilization. Neither of my parents are educated beyond high school. My mom, Peggy, worked in factories.  My father, Glenn, worked in construction and similar trades. I am from the the middle of nowhere river valley region of Arkansas.  Some call it "North West Arkansas", but it is truly, "The River Valley."  I grew up in the middle of the cliche one stop sign towns.  (Not even a stop light) I guess the closest town to me is Witcherville, Arkansas. Witcherville does not have a post office.  The closest town with a post office is Greenwood, Arkansas. Go Bulldogs!</p>
	<p>I would say the odds were stacked against me when it comes to potential future endeavors. When your parents are not college graduates, and you don't come from family farm or oil money, you really better work your tail off. My momma made sure we had a social calendar fully loaded with opportunities. She made sure we were in the best school in the area, Greenwood School District. Our involvment in Girl Scouts, sports, and church youth groups made us well rounded, and what I thought was "well connected." Very hilarious to think I was "well connected" now that I have lived in much bigger areas and see the lengths that families will go to for their kids to be "well connected." I live in Central Arkansas now. When we lived in Little Rock, our neighbors had their children enrolled in private elementary schools to ensure they were "well connected" from a very early age.</p>
	<p>If I could give any parents advice, I would say, "Instill the most confidence you can in your children while still keeping them in check."  My momma made us feel like we could quite literally do anything we ever wanted in life, except backtalk her.  Now that I am a teacher, I appreciate parents like my momma.</p>
	<p>I do not have any children. I was so focused on my career that creating a family took a backseat.  I have classic middle child syndrome.  I am proud dog mom though.  My siblings all have children.  Even though I am three hours away, I still manage to spoil my nieces and nephews as much as possible.  They will never want for anything while I am breathing.  I even tutor my oldest niece in her college chemistry classes.  She has a full ride to the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.  I am so proud of her.  I now understand the advantage my friends with educated parents were afforded.  I am so happy my momma taught me about work ethic though.  I can honestly say that is something my "better off" friends may lack.</p>
	<p>I recently moved to Cabot, Arkansas to teach in a new district.  Teaching now is so different than teaching when I was 23. I am now the same age as my students' parents.  It makes the conversations so much easier.  There are still some parents who are quite frankly delusional.  I call them "lawn mower parents."  They want the best for their children but they go about it in the worst ways.  These toxic parents want to be their child's friend and mow down any challenge their child faces instead of making them face the natural consequences of their poor decisions.  Holding students accountable has been much harder.  If you give the student of a "lawn mower parent" a detention, you better get ready for a war.  It is not pretty.  If you know a teacher, pray for them daily.</p>
