        <h2>Stay in the Know <span>With Your Student's Education</span></h2>
        <p><span class="txt1">Why is Computer Science Now a Required Credit for Graduation?</span></p>
	<p> Computer chips are in almost every device we encounter daily.  We know that people will be replaced by robots as the world progresses.  It is imperative that your student have a broad understanding of computers and their uses other than entertainment.</p>
	<p>I have spoke with many industry professionals outside of computer science.  These were business owners and CEOs.  They are seeking a workforce that frankly could be filled by robotic machines. They are running into issues with workers who are unreliable, unprofessional, and sometimes under the influence.  With a robotic machine, they would not have to worry about this lack of soft-skills.  It could all be programmed into a device that could operate 24/7 without any work hour violation.  They will need people to program these devices and maintain these devices.  The type of jobs needed in the next ten years may look entirely different than it does today.</p>
        <p>A recent<a href="https://time.com/5876604/machines-jobs-coronavirus">Time Magazine article</a> states that "Robots could replace as many as 2 million more workers in manufacturing alone by 2025, according to a recent paper by economists at MIT and Boston University."</p>

		<h4>Graduation Requirement</h4>
		<img src="images/grad2027.png" alt="graduation hat image">
		<br>
		<br>
      		<p>Starting with the 2027 class, every student in our state is required to take a full credit hour of computer science.  Jobs are being replaced by robots and computers daily.  Your students interact with technology for hours each day.  I am here to help them learn about computer science in a fun gamified way.</p>

		<h4>Concurrent Credit Options</h4>
		<img src="images/asubb.png" alt="ASU Beebe Logo">
		<br>
		<br>
      		<p>ASU Beebe has been so helpful in providing our school district with scholarships money so that students can take college level computer science courses while they are in high school.  The only requirement is a 2.5 GPA.  I am able to teach these courses to your student in person, or your student can take the concurrent credit courses online on their own.  I encourage students who want to further their computer scince education to look into taking these courses.</p>
