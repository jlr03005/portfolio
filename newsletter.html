            	<h3>Computer Science Education Week: December 4th through 10th</h3>
             	December 4-10, 2023 is Computer Science Education week(CSEDWeek).  CSEDWeek is an annual call to action to inspire K-12 students to learn computer science, advocate for equity in computer science education, and celebrate the contributions of students, teachers, and partners to the field.  We will be doing some fun activities during CSEDWeek to keep the kids inspired during their holiday breaks.  This is a stressful time of year for students and teachers.  It is nice to add a little spice to the otherwise monotonous days of winter.  Here is a link to more information about CSEDWeek. https://www.csedweek.org. </li>

            	<h3>BHS Capture the Flag Competition planned for December 12, 2023</h3>
            	<p>Arkansas Department of Education, Division of Elementary and Secondary Education, Office of Computer Science Specialists will be on Beebe High School Campus to host a capture the flag competition for our advanced computer science and cybersecurity students.  In the computer security exercise known as "Capture the Flag" (CTF), players seek for text strings, or "flags," that are covertly concealed in intentionally weak programs or webpages. They can be applied in instructional or competitive contexts.  These type of competitions not only teach students valuable computer science skills in real-time, they also teach students how to work as a team, think critically, and perseverance.<br>

            	<h3>Semester Exams Scheduled for December 15th and 18th</h3>
            	<p>A student must have a doctor’s excuse in order to be excused from a test during the scheduled testing time. If a student misses a test and fails to bring a doctor’s excuse, ten points will be deducted from his/her semester test grade. Students may check out of school for the day when they are finished with their tests if they have made PRIOR arrangements.</p>
		<p>Prior arrangements are:</p>
		<p>1) a note signed by the student’s parent(s) indicating when he/she is to check out, or</p>
		<p>2) other prior notification from the student’s parents.</p>
		<p>Students will NOT be allowed to use the school phone to make arrangements. Students who check out after finishing tests for the day will NOT be allowed to return to the school campus for the remainder of the school day. 
		Students are required to take their exam at the scheduled time. Students are not permitted to take the exam early.</p>
		<p>Students with four 4 or fewer unexcused absences may be exempt in a class if they maintain a “C” or better average in that class for the semester. Students with a D or an F in a class will not be exempt from the semester exam for that class.
		The student handbook states, "students who are suspended from school during the semester will not be exempt from any semester test for that semester." Please see Semester Test Policy in the student handbook on pg. 53 & 54</p>
