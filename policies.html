        <h1>Classroom Policies and Procedures<br>Mrs. Eubanks Computer Science Class</h1>

		<h2>Classroom Rules and Expectations</h2>
		<ol class="policies-ordered">
			<li>Enter class quietly and on time.</li>
			<li>Bring all supplies to class each day.</li>
			<li>Raise your hand to ask questions.</li>
			<li>Be polite and respectful to everyone.</li>
			<li>Keep hands, feet, and other body parts as well as objects to yourself.</li>
			<li>Inappropriate behavior and/or language will not be tolerated.</li>
		</ol>

		
		<h2>Daily work Grading policy</h2>
<p>We have work due daily. I update grades multiple times a week.  
If you see a "Z" in the gradebook, that means you have not done the assignment at all, but you can still make it up.  
If you see a "0" (number zero) in the gradebook that means you scored a zero on the assignment and the assignment can no longer be turned in. 
If the spot in the gradebook is blank, that means I haven't put a grade in for that assignment or that assignment may not be due yet.  
It is the student's responsibility to communicate with the teacher when extended time is needed.  
It is the student's responsibility to monitor their grades and let the teacher know of any mistakes they notice in the gradebook.</p>

<h2>Grade Weights<h2>
<p>I grade all work with a score out of 100.  This is more transparent for students and parents. </p>
<ul class="policies-unordered">
<li>Daily Work - 30%</li>
<li>Participation - 10%</li>
<li>Special Projects - 20%</li>
<li>Tests - 20%</li>
<li>Quizzes - 20%</li>
</ul>

<h2>Make Up Work</h2>
<p>It is the student’s responsibility to make up assignments that were missed due to an absence. Students need to speak to
the teacher at an appropriate time. I will try to assign someone to help with notes when there are absences.</p>

<h2>Correcting Low Grades</h2>
<p>This can be done if below a 70% for a major grade only once a 9 week period. The retest has to be done prior to the
next CA or CBA. The student has the potential to receive full credit for the retest.</p>
